The master of conundrums itself, the riddlebot will stump you with only the most difficult riddles, and if you ask nicely it might listen to your's.

## Getting a riddle
If you need to get your riddle on, riddlebot is happy to oblige. Just ask it: 

```
riddle me this?
```

and it will give you a random riddle to solve.

## Solving a riddle
If riddlebot has been kind, and given you an easy riddle, you can solve it by typeing:

```
riddle me done! [your answer]
```
It will let you know if you are right or wrong.

## Giving up
If a riddle is just to gosh-darn hard, but you have to know the answer, you can give by typing:

```
riddle me that?
```
Riddlebot will most likely mock you, but hey at least you got the answer.

## Expanding riddlebot's horizans
If you have a riddle that you think riddlebot should know for future daredevils, you can let it know by typing:

```
riddlebot get smart [your riddle]? [answer to the riddle]
```

## Testing

To test this script interactively, run:
