The master of conundrums itself, the riddlebot will stump you with only the most difficult riddles.

## Getting a riddle
If you need to get your riddle on, riddlebot is happy to oblige. Just mutter the words:

```
riddle me this?
```

and it will give you a random riddle to solve.

## Solving a riddle
If riddlebot has been kind, and given you an easy riddle, you can solve it by blurting out your answer:

```
riddle me done! [your answer]
```
It will let you know if you are right or wrong.

## Giving up
If a riddle is just to gosh-darn hard, but you have to know the answer, you can give up by yelling:

```
riddle me that?
```
Riddlebot will most likely mock you, but hey at least you'll get the answer.

## Testing

To test this script interactively, run:
